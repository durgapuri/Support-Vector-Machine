# Support-Vector-Machine
Using SVM from sklearn for classification.
## Image Classification

Given CiFAR-10 dataset, implemented linear SVM classifier to precit the classes of the test images.Images have been featurized as vectors.
Data has been preprocessed. Experiment has been done for different values of C. Metrics like Accuracy score, F1-score, Confusion matrix and
Classification report has been reported in the notebook.

## Classify Author Tag

Given a dataset which contains a excerpts of text written by some author and the
corresponding author tag, implemented a SVM classifier to predict the author tag
of the test text excerpts. Feature extraction has been done for text segments. Experiment has been done for different values of C
and different kernels. Metrics like Accuracy score, F1-score, Confusion matrix and
Classification report has been reported in the notebook.
